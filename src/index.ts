/**
 * TensorFlow.js Reinforcement Learning Example: Balancing a Cart-Pole System.
 *
 * The simulation, training, testing and visualization parts are written
 * purely in JavaScript and can run in the web browser with WebGL acceleration.
 *
 * This reinforcement learning (RL) problem was proposed in:
 *
 * - Barto, Sutton, and Anderson, "Neuronlike Adaptive Elements That Can Solve
 *   Difficult Learning Control Problems," IEEE Trans. Syst., Man, Cybern.,
 *   Vol. SMC-13, pp. 834--846, Sept.--Oct. 1983
 * - Sutton, "Temporal Aspects of Credit Assignment in Reinforcement Learning",
 *   Ph.D. Dissertation, Department of Computer and Information Science,
 *   University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 1984.
 *
 * It later became one of OpenAI's gym environmnets:
 *   https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py
